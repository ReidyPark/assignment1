GitHub repository address: https://github.com/ReidyPark/assignment1

Assumptions:   I made the assumption that the values for minimum number of wines
               ordered was the total number or wines ordered and choosing a 
               minimum value for this.

Known bugs: The input for the winery name has been disabled due to problems
            with the sql query - if there is no value for the wine name, then
            I have had trouble getting it to generate the query.
            I ran out of time to fix it.
            
            There is no complete error function for checking for input as I ran
            out of time - the values go through a validator - but I didn't get 
            a chance to fully test this.

Deleted github repository, and created a new one because I had forgotten to use
the .gitignore for the connection data, exposing this.
